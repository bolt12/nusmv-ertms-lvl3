# ERTMS Model, Specification and Verification

This repository exposes the result of a project done in the scope of the [_Specification and Modelling_](wiki.di.uminho.pt/twiki/bin/view/Education/MFES1819/EM) course at University of Minho.

The objective is to model, specify and verify, using [NuSMV](http://nusmv.fbk.eu/NuSMV/userman/v21/nusmv_2.html), part of the level 3 hybrid concept of ERMTS/ETCS. You can find the introductory document [here](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/421697/1/ERTMS_L3_Hybrid.pdf) and the full specification [here](https://ertms.be/sites/default/files/2018-07/16E0421C_HL3-clean.pdf).

## Project overview

The project consists of 4 files. Each file tries to model a given part of the specification and to verify a couple o properties/invariants using LTL/CTL.
